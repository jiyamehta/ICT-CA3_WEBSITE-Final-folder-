                            <p>Do you know that you can code using just whitespaces? The programming language that makes it possible is called 'Whitespace'. All it takes to write a program in this language is to use the spaces, tabs, and linefeeds. The interpreter ignores any non-whitespace characters.</p>

                            <p> The first photograph ever taken in 1826 took 8 hours to expose! The creator of that camera, Louis Daguerre, was able to lower that time drastically to just 15 minutes in 1839.</p>
